For SaltString generation:\n   - Use OsRng.try_fill_bytes() to manually fill a byte array\n   - Use SaltString::encode_b64() to create the salt string\n   - This bypasses the CryptoRng trait requirement\n\n2. For ML-KEM encapsulate() (requires CryptoRng):\n   - Use OsRng.unwrap_err() which returns UnwrapErr\u003cOsRng\u003e\n   - UnwrapErr\u003cOsRng\u003e implements CryptoRng trait\n   - This provides panic-on-error semantics expected for OsRng\n\nChanges applied:\n- src/crypto/kdf.rs: Updated salt generation to use manual byte filling\n- src/crypto/streaming.rs: Updated all test code to use try_fill_bytes()\n- All compilation errors resolved\n- All tests passing\n\nReady to proceed with ML-KEM integration using OsRng.unwrap_err() approach.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"claude","created_at":"2025-11-21T07:59:10.0297625-06:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T16:56:44.0577044-06:00","closed_at":"2025-11-21T16:56:44.0577044-06:00","source_repo":"."}
