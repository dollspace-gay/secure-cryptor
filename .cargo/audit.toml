# Cargo audit configuration for Tesseract Vault
#
# This configuration allows us to acknowledge certain warnings that are
# not security-critical or cannot be fixed due to external dependencies.

# Note: We acknowledge these warnings because:
# 1. GTK3 is required by tray-icon for Linux system tray support
# 2. These are UI-only dependencies, not used in cryptographic operations
# 3. GTK4 migration is tracked in upstream tray-icon project
# 4. No known security vulnerabilities, only "unmaintained" status
# 5. The functionality still works correctly on all supported platforms
